## CI/CD
  # WHAT IS CI/CD 
    - Building automated workflows for faster releases.
    - CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). 
    - It's a set of practices and tools designed to improve the software development process by automating builds, testing and deployment, enabling you to ship code changes faster and reliably.
    - Continuous Integration (CI) -> Automatically builds, tests and integrates code changes within a shared repository.
    - Continuous Delivery (CD) -> Automatically delivers code changes to production ready environments for approval.
    - Continuous Deployment (CD) -> Automatically Deployes code changes to customers directly.
    - Automation is a core principle for achieving DevOps sucess and CI/CD is a critical component. CI/CD comprises of continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment.
      put together, they form a "CI/CD Pipeline" - A series of Automated workflows that help DevOps team cut down on manual tasks.
      
  # Continuous Deployment VS. Continuous Delivery
    - When someone says CI/CD, the “CD” they’re referring to is usually continuous delivery, not continuous deployment. 
    - What’s the difference? In a CI/CD pipeline that uses continuous delivery, automation pauses when developers push to production. 
        A human—your operations, security, or compliance team—still needs to manually sign off before final release, adding more delays. On the other hand, 
        continuous deployment automates the entire release process. Code changes are deployed to customers as soon as they pass all the required tests.
    - Continuous deployment is the ultimate example of DevOps automation. That doesn’t mean it’s the only way to do CI/CD, or the “right” way. 
        Since continuous deployment relies on rigorous testing tools and a mature testing culture, most software teams start with continuous delivery and 
        integrate more automated testing over time.

  # Why CI/CD
    - The shortest answer: speed. While faster development is the most well-known benefit of CI/CD, a continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline enables much more.
      ~ Development velocity: Ongoing feedback allows developers to commit smaller changes more often, versus waiting for one release.
      ~ Stability and reliability: Automated, continuous testing ensures that codebases remain stable and release-ready at any time.
      ~ Business growth: Freed up from manual tasks, organizations can focus resources on innovation, customer satisfaction, and paying down technical debt.
